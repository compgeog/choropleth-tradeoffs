# Exploring the Tradeoffs among Multiple Criteria for Choropleth Maps

This repository includes two Jupyter notebooks and necessary data used in the notebooks. The purpose of these notebooks is to illustrate how to (1) compute all classifications and (2) illustrate how to explore the tradeoffs among these classifications. 

- [explore_choropleth_computation.ipynb](https://github.com/compgeog/choropleth-tradeoffs/blob/main/explore_choropleth_computation.ipynb)
- [explore_choropleth_results.ipynb](https://github.com/compgeog/choropleth-tradeoffs/blob/main/explore_choropleth_results.ipynb)

Clicking on the notebooks will preview the content. There are at least two approaches to actually run the notebooks. They can be downloaded to a local computer and run from a Jupyter server there. You can also click on the *Open in Colab* button at the top of each notebook to open it Google Colab and run from there (this requires a Google account to run). Please note you may not be able to finish running the first notebook (computation) if you use a free colab plan because it the intensive computation using parallel computing may require resources that exceed what is allocated.
